## Changelog

### 2.13.4
- Fix : Typo in the analytics script tag — `ata-cookies` was missing its "d", silently disabling cookie mode (no visitors/sessions/returning visitors)
  - The attribute is now correctly `data-cookies="true"`

### 2.13.3
- Feat : New /health endpoint for uptime monitoring
  - GET and HEAD return 200 with `{"status":"ok","timestamp":...,"version":...}` in JSON, with `cache-control: no-store` and no auth
  - Pure request handler — no database, no external calls, no pageview tracking (it never loads the SPA or its analytics script)

### 2.13.2
- Change : Added cookieless analytics tracking (analytics.lv0.eu) to the site
  - Records page views across client-side navigation; no cookies, no consent storage, no fingerprinting, no visitor ids

### 2.13.1
- Fix : Importing an Excel question file no longer leaves the last question without a correct answer
  - Affected the Import tool and the Audit tool's "compare against Excel source" side, since both share the same Excel parser
  - Only templates with no dedicated "correct answer" column were affected (the default template); templates with an explicit correct-answer column were never affected

### 2.13.0
- Feat : New tool — Editor, a full QTI question editor
  - Open a TAO QTI export and edit the prompt, answer choices and correct answer(s), per-choice score, character limit on open questions, and metadata (title/label/language, TAO test options, LOM/manifest metadata) for every question
  - Simple mode offers a friendly form for every field; Raw XML mode edits the underlying XML directly (per question, and per test.xml/imsmanifest.xml section when present), with the two views always in sync
  - Export rebuilds the ZIP with only the edited bytes changed, so the package stays importable into TAO

### 2.12.1
- Fix : Importing/exporting a TAO zip whose test references the same item more than once no longer crashes with a Svelte `each_key_duplicate` error
  - The question lists in Export, Import and the metadata matrix now key each rendered item by id **and** position, so repeated items render instead of throwing

### 2.12.0
- Feat : Library search results can now be viewed as a list, a table or cards
  - The layout switcher sits next to the result count; matched terms stay highlighted in every view
- Feat : Hold questions in memory from the search results and turn them into an exam in one step
  - The bookmark button on each result holds it; the Exams tab then offers "Create & Add" or adding the held questions to an existing exam
- Feat : "Ask AI to write SQL" in the Library sidebar generates a ready-to-paste prompt (including the full database schema) for ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude or any other assistant
  - The resulting SQL runs in the existing read-only SQL query console

### 2.11.8
- Improve : The IAT page now shows a guiding empty state before a workbook is loaded, instead of a blank area

### 2.11.7
- Improve : Full end-to-end browser test suite (18 tests)
  - Every page is loaded and checked for rendering and console errors; the error page, Library SQLite worker boot, Format tool happy path (real QTI zip), phone drawer navigation and slides keyboard navigation are all covered

### 2.11.6
- Refactor : The presentation deck (/slides) is split into one component per slide
  - The 1991-line page becomes 8 slide components plus shared data, styles and a reusable card-tilt helper — no visual change
  - Unused styles from removed slides were dropped along the way

### 2.11.5
- Remove : Dead code cleanup — obsolete export helper copy, unused CSV adapter, unused styles and leftover debug logging removed
- Refactor : One shared file-download helper now serves Export, Format, Library, Audit and IAT (five separate copies before)
- Fix : Every button now declares its type explicitly, and the shared Button component honours its `type` prop
- Improve : "Coming soon" tiles on the home page are no longer fake links; tooltips show on keyboard focus and dismiss with Escape

### 2.11.4
- Improve : Dialogs are now fully keyboard-accessible
  - Escape closes any dialog, Tab stays trapped inside it, and focus returns to where you were when it closes
  - Screen readers now announce the dialog with its title
- Feat : Friendly error page — broken links and unexpected errors now show a styled page with a way back home instead of a blank default

### 2.11.3
- Fix : Import page no longer re-parses the workbook once per past visit
  - Store subscriptions leaked every time the page was opened, multiplying parse work after navigating back and forth
- Fix : Unreadable or corrupt Excel files now show an error notification in Import and IAT instead of failing silently
- Improve : IAT statistics parsing extracted into a typed, unit-tested module; missing sheets (`Speed_Pages`, `Questions`, `Alternatives`) now produce a clear error
- Fix : A flaky license test that could accept a tampered signature is now deterministic

### 2.11.2
- Refactor : Export tool internals reorganized for reliability — no behaviour change
  - Sorting, shuffling, merge and compare logic now runs through explicit, tested functions instead of hidden store side effects
  - Question lists in the preview and mapping table are now keyed, so per-question show/hide toggles stay attached to the right question when the order changes
  - Removed an unused internal error queue in favour of the app-wide notification system

### 2.11.1
- Improve : The Export tool's question logic (exam switching, sorting, shuffling, mappings, compare mode) is now covered by an automated test suite, protecting these behaviours against future regressions

### 2.11.0
- Improve : Test suite now runs with Vitest under npm, and Playwright end-to-end tests are in place
  - All existing unit tests were migrated from `bun test` to Vitest (`npm run test:unit`) so the whole project works with a single package manager
  - New `npm run test:e2e` runs browser tests against the built site; `npm test` runs both
  - Tests are now type-checked by `npm run check` (they were previously excluded), and outdated library-schema tests were fixed to follow the current database version
- Fix : Corrected a TypeScript import error on the home page (`$lib/docs.ts` extension)

### 2.10.1
- Fix : Bullet detection now catches markers running together in one paragraph
  - Previously only a bullet at the very start of a line was recognized; now `• item` or `- item` is detected anywhere in the text, so a question opens with its list already correct, before any editing
  - The preview now also shows the question's own prompt text, bolded, exactly as it will appear after export — previously bold was invisible until you downloaded the ZIP

### 2.10.0
- Feat : Format now auto-formats every question on export, and bold is back
  - Exporting a package auto-detects bullet lists and line breaks for every question's stem, and bolds every plain-text prompt — no need to open a question first
  - The per-question editor is now for previewing the automatic result and adjusting anything the detection missed, not the only way to get a question formatted

### 2.9.1
- Improve : Audit's "Custom" Excel template now seeds from the previously selected preset
  - Switching to Custom copies the column letters and row layout of the preset that was active, so you only need to adjust the field(s) that actually differ instead of retyping the whole mapping

### 2.9.0
- Feat : Audit gets a "Custom" Excel template
  - Alongside the fixed FIN / OLD_BOSA / OLD_FIN presets, you can now type in your own column letters (title, prompt, answer, competency, indicator, descriptions) and row layout (first data row, answers per question, rows to skip) — the same manual mapping the Import route already offers — so any Excel source can be audited, not just the three known layouts

### 2.9.0
- Feat : Format is now an interactive question-stem editor
  - Pick any question from an uploaded TAO QTI export and rewrite its stem by hand, with a live preview
  - Lines starting with "•" or "-" are auto-detected as a bulleted list; other line breaks become line breaks
  - Replaces the previous one-click "bold every prompt" behavior — export now produces an `-stems.zip`
### 2.8.1
- Fix : The exam's extracted time limit is now visible in the printed/PDF export
  - The time badge was wrapped in a `hide-print` container together with the on-screen-only tool badges (Zoom, Highlighter, …); it now prints while those screen-only badges stay hidden

### 2.8.0
- Fix : Open-question ("QO"/"OV") prompts no longer appear twice in the export
  - The extra-prompt dedup check compared serialized HTML strings, which silently failed for open questions because the XML serializer re-declares the inherited namespace on isolated fragments; it now checks DOM ancestry instead
- Fix : "Exemple question ouverte" / "Voorbeeld open vraag" are now recognized as instruction pages
  - They're hidden/shown together with the other instructions via the existing "Show Instructions" setting, matching the QCM example page
- Feat : Each question now shows its own TAO tools badge (Zoom, Highlighter, Calculator, Review screen, …) below its content, instead of only once for the whole exam

### 2.7.4
- Improve : Presentation deck remembers the current slide in the URL
  - Each slide updates `?slide=N` (shallow routing, no navigation), so a reload or a shared link lands on the same slide instead of resetting to the cover
  - Out-of-range or missing values fall back gracefully to a valid slide

### 2.7.3
- Fix : Pipeline slide — bottom row now fills the full width on mobile
  - The collapsed serpentine's bottom row switches to a `column-reverse` flex but inherited the base `align-items: center`, shrinking each card to its content width; set `align-items: stretch` so it matches the full-width top row

### 2.7.2
- Improve : Problem slide now *shows* the scattered-work chaos
  - The calm chip row is replaced by a jittering heap of overlapping file cards — the four real sources plus version-soup clutter (`bank_v3_FINAL.xlsx`, `draft_v7.pdf`) — with a card tumbling loose, floating Excel-error tags (`#REF!`, `#VALUE!`, `merge conflict`, …), pulsing warning marks and a nervous "panic" shudder over an alarm-tinted halo
  - Uses the danger token for errors only, stays monochrome elsewhere, and freezes into a static layout under `prefers-reduced-motion`

### 2.7.1
- Feat : Slides doc card — `/docs` now links to the presentation deck
  - New "Presentation" section on the docs page with its own card, icon and description, pointing to `/docs/slides`; kept out of the homepage's numbered module grid since it's not an exam-workflow tool
  - Added `slides.md` documentation in EN/FR/NL describing the deck and how to navigate it

### 2.7.0
- Feat : Presentation deck at `/slides` — a full-screen, keyboard-driven tour of TAO
  - 11 slides covering the problem, vision, audience, the seven modules, the exam pipeline, architecture, strengths, a use case, roadmap and a close
  - Arrow / space navigation, clickable progress dots and a slide counter, built with the TAO design language (dot grid, single accent, reduced-motion aware)

### 2.6.0
- Feat : Build fake exams in Library mode
  - New "Exams" tab — pick questions from the library, assemble them into a new exam, reorder and remove items, with a live preview matching the export-page look
  - Fake exams are stored in their own database tables (separate from imported tests/questions) and export straight to Excel

### 2.5.3
- Feat : Doc switcher in breadcrumb — clicking the doc slug on any `/docs/[slug]` page opens a dropdown to jump to another doc, mirroring the tool switcher

### 2.5.2
- Fix : `.taodb` inline code invisible in dark mode on docs pages
  - Tailwind typography was overriding the code element text color; added explicit `color: var(--text)` to the Markdown.svelte code rule

### 2.5.1
- Fix : Sidebar open/close now slides the main content smoothly instead of teleporting it
  - Replaced `{#if}` Svelte transition with a CSS width transition on a sticky wrapper so both panels animate together

### 2.5.0
- Feat : Multilingual documentation (EN / FR / NL) with stack page
  - All tool docs reorganised into `static/docs/en|fr|nl/` — language switcher on each doc page
  - All 7 tool docs translated to French and Dutch from the English source
  - New "Project stack" documentation page (`/docs/stack`) covering Cloudflare Pages hosting and GitHub, also translated to FR and NL
  - Stack section added as a distinct section on the `/docs` index page
- Refactor : `docs.ts` is now the single source of truth for tool metadata
  - Homepage `routes` array removed — derived from `docs` at runtime (`slug → path`)
  - `stackDocs` export added for infrastructure entries; `getDoc` searches both arrays

### 2.4.0
- Feat : Global debug panel, changelog page, and per-tool documentation
  - The debug panel now opens from a button in the top navigation bar on every route, instead of only on the landing page
  - New `/changelog` page renders the full version history
  - New `/docs` section with a dedicated documentation page for each tool (Import, Forge, Export, Format, IAT, Library, Audit), linked from the header
  - Replaced the export-only documentation/changelog modals with the shared pages

### 2.3.0
- Fix : Audit now parses Excel the same way as the Import route
  - The audit reads the Excel source with the Import parser (`Question.parseSheet`) and templates (FIN / OLD_BOSA / OLD_FIN) instead of a separate parser, so a file that imports cleanly now audits cleanly
  - Questions are matched by order/position (the TAO export is generated from the Excel, so they share order and count) instead of fuzzy text similarity — far more reliable matching
  - Unmatched questions and Excel↔QTI count mismatches are now treated as critical (Bloquant) and fail the audit, instead of being shown as a soft warning
  - Replaced the audit's match-threshold slider and bespoke column config with an Import-style template picker

### 2.2.0
- Feat : Password-protected, encrypted library export
  - Set, change, or remove a password in the Database panel
  - Exported `.taodb` files are encrypted with AES-GCM (PBKDF2-derived key) — unreadable without the password
  - Opening an encrypted library prompts for the password; wrong passwords are rejected
  - Plaintext `.taodb` files still open as before (backward compatible)
  - Encryption protects the exported file; the in-browser working copy stays unencrypted

### 2.1.0
- Feat : Excel import support in the Library route
  - Import questions directly from Excel files (Excel-only mode)
  - Import TAO ZIP exports enriched with competency data from a matching Excel file (ZIP + Excel merged mode)
  - Column picker (ExcelColumnConfig) embedded in the Import tab with preset selector, answer layout toggle, and per-column letter inputs
  - Source badges on import job rows to distinguish ZIP, Excel, and merged imports
  - Queue supports all three sources via a builder-closure pattern — no new worker commands required

### 1.7.1
- Fix : Excel sheet selection dropdown now works properly
  - Fixed reactive state binding for availableSheets and selectedSheet in AuditTab
  - Sheet selector now properly displays and updates when different sheets are selected
  - Converted variables to Svelte 5 reactive state for proper change detection

### 1.7.0
- Feat : Export format selector in sidebar
  - Added dropdown selector below "Get PDF" button to choose between PDF or JSON export
  - Button dynamically updates icon and text based on selected format
